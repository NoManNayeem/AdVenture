  - Develop endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting campaigns.

### 3.2 Bidding Strategy
- **Feature**: Simple bidding strategies based on CPM or CPC.
- **Implementation**:
  - Add bidding strategy fields to the `Campaign` model.
  - Develop logic to calculate bid prices based on strategy.
  - Implement endpoints for retrieving and setting bidding strategies.

### 3.3 Ad Creative Management
- **Feature**: Manage ad creatives (images, videos, HTML5 ads).
- **Implementation**:
  - Create `Creative` model with fields for different ad formats.
  - Develop endpoints for uploading, retrieving, and deleting creatives.
  - Implement validation to ensure creatives meet platform standards.

### 3.4 Targeting Options
- **Feature**: Basic demographic, behavioral, and location-based targeting.
- **Implementation**:
  - Add targeting fields to the `Campaign` model.
  - Develop logic to filter audiences based on targeting options.
  - Implement endpoints for setting and retrieving targeting options.

## 4. Real-Time Bidding (RTB)

### 4.1 Bid Requests & Responses
- **Feature**: Handle bid requests and responses in real-time.
- **Implementation**:
  - Develop an API to receive bid requests from SSP.
  - Implement logic to evaluate bid responses based on campaign settings.
  - Use WebSockets or similar technology for real-time communication.

### 4.2 Auction Mechanism
- **Feature**: Simple auction mechanism where the highest bid wins.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create an `Auction` model to handle bid submissions.
  - Develop logic to determine the winning bid based on highest value.
  - Implement endpoints for submitting and retrieving auction results.

### 4.3 Latency Optimization
- **Feature**: Ensure low latency in the bidding process.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use caching strategies to reduce database queries.
  - Optimize database indexes for faster access.
  - Implement asynchronous processing for real-time operations.

## 5. Display Advertisement Based on RTB

### 5.1 Ad Delivery
- **Feature**: Serve ads based on the outcome of the RTB auction.
- **Implementation**:
  - Develop endpoints for serving ads to the frontend.

  - Develop endpoints to retrieve tracking data.
  - Implement reporting logic to summarize ad performance.

## 6. Machine Learning (ML) Implementation

### 6.1 Predictive Bidding Models
- **Feature**: Use ML to predict bid values based on historical data.
- **Implementation**:
  - Collect historical bid data and store it in a database.
  - Develop ML models to predict optimal bid values.
  - Integrate models into the bidding process for real-time predictions.

### 6.2 Audience Segmentation
- **Feature**: Use ML for clustering users into segments.
